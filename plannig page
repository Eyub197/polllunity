if the poll haven't started it will have a badge that the poll havent started yet
    the user can see the options but he can't vote and in the options tab to we 
    will tell the user that it havesent started yet and will start after { time }

if the poll have started it will have badge started and it will let the user vote 
    after the user votes the poll will be tell him that he already woted and i t will be closed  but with 
    diffrent colors he cant click the button becouse it will disapiear and he will have to wait until the end

if the poll has ended then we will give them a let say 2 days time to be able to se the results, 
    it will have badge ended and have button see results wich will show the results in a statistic
    after the 2 days ends it will be transformed to expired polls

if there are polls with the same category there will be a place to see there options and resulets
    in the current poll from the same category there will be a button if there used be a poll with the same name
    "see older stats or something like that" and in the click it will show them older stats and then there will be a 
    button to comeback 

Eventually try adding again the poll voted thinks

before giving it make the crud opereations all return error and if there are no anything put messaage
loading state the logo how is roatating until its loads
the serveraction froms make them reusable(create one with optionl props for defoutl values) will get the job thone
